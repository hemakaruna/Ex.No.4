### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

### 🚰 Smart Sensors: Detecting and Preventing Water Leakage in Urban Pipelines

**Procedure:**

**1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:**
**Overview**

**Domain: Urban Water Management**
Focus: Detection, localization, and mitigation of leaks in pressurized water distribution networks using smart sensors and analytics.
Target audience: Municipal utilities, IoT/embedded teams, researchers, smart-city architects, and software engineers.

---

**Scenario & Use Case**

Urban pipelines run under streets and buildings; small leaks can become big losses (water, money, infrastructure damage) and health risks. The goal is an end-to-end system that detects leaks early, pinpoints location, and triggers automated or semi-automated mitigation to minimize impact.

Primary Use Case: A utility deploys smart sensor nodes (acoustic, pressure, flow, and humidity) across a district. When anomalies occur, edge analytics flag probable leaks, cloud services refine models using fleet data, and operators get prioritized alerts with location and recommended action (shutoff, repair crew dispatch).

---

**Main Objectives:**

. 🛑 Prioritise public safety & water quality (prevent contamination from ingress).

. 🔍 Detect leaks early (micro-leaks before pipe collapse).

. 📍 Localize leaks precisely to reduce search costs.

. ⚡ Minimize false alarms through sensor fusion + ML.

. 🔁 Automate response workflows (valve control, crew dispatch).

. 🌱 Reduce non-revenue water (NRW) and conserve resources.

---

**2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:**

**Idea Generation Prompts:**

. “What sensor mix best detects small leaks on cast-iron vs PVC pipes in urban distribution networks?”

. “Design a low-power edge algorithm that flags leaks using only pressure and flow data.”

. “How can acoustic signatures be clustered to identify leak severity and pipe material?”

. “What policies and human-in-the-loop steps should follow an automated valve shutoff?”

. “How to protect sensor network from tampering and ensure data integrity?”

---

### Generated Ideas (high-level solutions)

. Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion: Combine acoustic, pressure, flow, vibration, humidity, and temperature sensors to increase detection accuracy.

. Edge Analytics for Real-Time Detection: Lightweight anomaly detectors (CUSUM, EWMA, simple neural nets) on gateway nodes to flag events within seconds.

. Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS): Use fiber-optic DAS where available for continuous line monitoring.

. Event Correlation Engine: Correlate data across adjacent sensors to localize leaks and reduce false positives.

. Smart Valves & Actuators: Automate valve closure in high-confidence, high-severity leaks; otherwise escalate to operators.

. Federated/Fleet Learning: Privacy-preserving model sharing across city districts or utilities to improve detection models without moving raw data.

. Citizen Reporting Integration: Merge sensor events with crowd reports via a mobile app to enrich the decision signal.

. Predictive Maintenance: Use anomaly patterns over time to schedule pipe replacement before failure.

---

**Persona and Context Prompts:**

Prompt: “What should the system communicate to operators, field crews, and citizens for clarity and trust?”

**For Operators (Utility Control Room):**

. Real-time dashboard: “Pressure drop detected between node A → B. Probable leak at 32-45 m from node B. Confidence: 87%.”

. Suggested actions: isolate zone, dispatch crew, or schedule investigation.

. Historical context: show prior events in the same pipe segment and maintenance history.

**For Field Crews:**

. Mobile alert with GPS coordinates, acoustic spectrogram snippets, last known flow/pressure timeline, and suggested access points.

**For Citizens:**

. Transparent notifications if service will be interrupted: “Planned outage in your area for leak repair — expected duration 3–5 hours.”

. Educational messages on water conservation and safety.

---

### Predictive & Safety Features

. Anomaly Detection Models: Statistical (rolling mean, CUSUM), rule-based thresholds, and ML (LSTM/Transformer for time series) depending on compute budget.

. Localization Algorithms: Time-of-arrival differences in acoustic sensors, hydraulic model inversion using pressure/flow drops, and triangulation using correlated sensor events.

. Redundancy & Fail-Safe: Multiple sensors per critical segment; failover to conservative safety policies (e.g., auto-isolate when rapid pressure collapse + acoustic signature match).

. Secure Communications: Mutual TLS, hardware-backed keys, and regular attestation of firmware.

. Human-in-the-Loop: Require operator confirmation for automated valve closure unless catastrophic indicators met.

. Energy & Cost Efficiency: Duty-cycling, event-driven sampling, and low-power wide-area networking (LoRaWAN / NB-IoT) for battery nodes.
